# ProPlus - Angular Project

Pro Plus is a project management application developed using Angular for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend. The Angular application calls the endpoints provided by the Spring Boot application to manage tasks and projects effectively, creating a seamless experience for users. 

## Last Update

- Adapted the application to work with JWT authentication.

- Updated most components to align with the latest version of the backend application.

- Redesigned the project display component for a better visual experience.

- Created a new UI for joining a project.

## Current Work

- Improving the UI/UX for other components.

- Implementing the createProject functionality (currently not functional).

- Adapting remaining parts of the application to work with the latest backend version.

- Optimizing the code for better performance and maintainability.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
